This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. Accurately identifying customers who are likely to leave can help businesses take proactive steps to improve retention.

Telecom customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a telecommunications provider and switch to a competitor. This can happen due to various reasons, such as poor network quality, high pricing, lack of customer support, or better offers from rival companies.
Churn is a critical metric for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Companies use predictive analytics and machine learning to identify potential churners and implement strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
