Fraud detection using machine learning refers to the use of algorithms and statistical models to identify fraudulent activities in various domains, 
such as financial transactions, insurance claims, and online purchases. Machine learning-based fraud detection systems analyze historical data to 

recognize patterns associated with fraudulent behavior and flag suspicious activities in real time.
These systems typically employ techniques such as anomaly detection, supervised learning (using labeled fraud and non-fraud data), 
and unsupervised learning (detecting unusual patterns without predefined labels). Unlike traditional rule-based fraud detection, 
machine learning models continuously improve by learning from new data, making them more effective at identifying emerging fraud tactics.
