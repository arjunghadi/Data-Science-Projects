A movie recommender system using the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset is designed to suggest films to users based on their preferences and viewing history. These systems leverage machine learning techniques to analyze movie metadata, user interactions, and ratings to provide personalized recommendations.
How It Works
- Content-Based Filtering – Recommends movies similar to a given film by analyzing features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords.
- Collaborative Filtering – Suggests movies based on user behavior, identifying patterns in ratings and preferences.
- Hybrid Models – Combines both approaches to enhance recommendation accuracy.

TMDB Dataset
The TMDB dataset contains rich metadata, including:
- Movie titles, genres, and descriptions
- Cast and crew details
- Popularity scores and user ratings
- Keywords associated with films

Implementation
Developers use cosine similarity, neural networks, or matrix factorization techniques to build recommendation models. Libraries like Scikit-learn, Surprise, and TensorFlow help in processing and predicting user preferences.
